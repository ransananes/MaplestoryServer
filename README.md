## Emulator Setup Instructions:
To set up and install the MapleStory emulator, follow these steps:

1. Install a MySQL server (such as WAMP or XAMPP) and import the provided MySQL file named `nodems.sql`.
2. Convert WZ files to NX format using a tool like diamondo25's WZ to NX converter. Place the NX format files in the specified directory (`provider` -> `nx`).
3. Place the localhost/client/redirector files in your MapleStory folder, ensuring to update the IP address as necessary using diamondo25's tool, strEdit.
4. Install Node.js from the official website.
5. Open the `launch_servers.cmd` file to start the emulator. If necessary, it will install required node modules. After module installation, close and reopen the file to launch the emulator.
